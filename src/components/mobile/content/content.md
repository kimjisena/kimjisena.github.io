# About me
## who am i
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio!
I'm Ponsiano Jisena, a developer from Tanzania. I've spent the best part of my life conjuring ghouls and daemons hidden deep in my computer.

It's been both an exciting journey and a humbling experience. I have witnessed processes give birth to other processes only to end up killing them both. I have read hundreds of manual pages only to be referred to other huge and almost cryptic manuals.

It's an infinite loop that I enjoy living, and I intend to keep it that way for as long as my heart keeps its beat.

## what do i
I spend most of my active time writing computer code, reading computer code, reading books on computer code and wrestling with my Linux box (probably I should get a life).

I'm currently investing more time in frontend development partly because it's very accessible and feedback is immediate. To truly appreciate a C 'Hello World' program, one has to know just how involved the standard I/O stream is.

On the other hand, things happen very fast when one's declaring UI using React's JSX syntax...'Hello React' just hits different.

Here are some tools that commonly cross my hands on (almost) a day to day basis.

(skill cards go here....)

Wait, Linux and Arch Linux? Redundancy you say? There was no way Arch couln't have made the list...cool toy that one.

## what love i
I like everything tech. I know this because I never get enough of it and no matter how many interests I develop, tech always comes first.

I enjoy reading books (fiction and technical books). Language is another phenomenon that never ceases to amaze me. I'm currently acquiring Spanish, alongside a bunch of other programming languages.

Not to sound philosophical or something but, language shapes thoughts and thoughts shape one's subjective reality, and I'd like my own reality to be shaped by as many languages (both human and machine languages) as I can acquire.

I enjoy both ancient and contemporary history. Humanity has come a long way and history tells the best of humanity's stories.

This whole thing is turning into a blog, isn't it?

# My projects
Ever since I came across Marijn Heverbeke's Eloquent JavaScript, my understanding of the web has changed drastically. Then naturally I acquired the React philosophy and workflow...add Tailwind CSS to the mix and I'm glued to my screen for life! 

Here are some interesting projects I'm working on. You can see more on my GitHub profile right here(link to GitHub)
