# Portfolio/Blog React Project

## About This Project

I built this project specifically to test (and hopefully cement) my understanding of React and the whole ecosystem of it's related libraries. I kinda liked the end-result and so I decided to share it with the world.

I'm currently hosting this project as my portfolio on GitHub Pages (thanks GitHub!), so if you'd like to see it live it's [right here](https://kimjisena.github.io).

If you'd like to use this project as a basis for your portfolio, or any other project for that matter, please do feel free to do so!

And more importantly, let me know about what you think I could have done better (or worse)...I'm a work in progress, just like this project.

```$ cd blog```

```$ npm run start```

```<cast your UI spells here>```
